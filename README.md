### How to Run the Program for EMNIST dataset
Download the "EMNIST_CRNN.ipynb," and upload it to a Colab notebook. In the Colab interface, run all cells at once. Wait for the program to finish, and the output will show at the bottom.

### How to Run and see our progress on Kaggle dataset
Please use either juypter notebook or google colab, and please take a look at the dataset at this link:

### Explanations
Some in the preprocessing_code directory is code that is used to preprocess the data, some of the files might include partial code as this is just rough work code and brainstorming ideas. 

For the word_preprocess directory, originally our group decided we needed to convert words into vectors to make them feedable in to the CRNN, so we used word2vec at first to preprocess text. In the end, we decided in another direction, but we wanted to show some of the exploratory code we had. 

For the kaggle_dataset_training_attempts file, it shows our previous attempts at training the crnn model on the kaggle dataset. There we also included some test cases for the dataset class loader and its individual functions. These files are responsible by everyone in our group as we brainstormed and coding different parts of it together by ourselves and over Zoom.
